# Department Filtering Fix - Quick Stats & Usage Reports

## Problem Identified

The Quick Stats and Usage Reports were showing empty data when filtering by department because of a **data modeling issue**:

### Root Cause
- **Usage records** were storing the **user's department** (who used the item)
- **Filtering queries** were filtering by the **user's department** in usage records
- **Expected behavior** should filter by the **item's department** (which department owns the item)

### Example Scenario
1. User from Department AAA uses an item that belongs to Department BBB
2. Usage record stores: `department = "AAA"` (user's department)
3. When filtering Quick Stats for Department BBB, no data was found
4. **Correct behavior**: Should show the usage because the item belongs to Department BBB

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Repository Queries

**File: `UsageRepository.java`**

#### Before (Incorrect):
```java
// Filtering by user's department in usage record
@Query("SELECT u FROM Usage u WHERE u.department = :department")
List<Usage> findByDepartmentOrderByUsedAtDesc(String department);

@Query(value = "SELECT DATE(used_at) as usage_date, SUM(quantity_used) as total_usage " +
               "FROM item_usage " +
               "WHERE department = :department " +
               "GROUP BY DATE(used_at)")
List<Object[]> getDailyUsageByDepartment(@Param("department") String department);
```

#### After (Correct):
```java
// Filtering by item's department
@Query("SELECT u FROM Usage u WHERE u.item.department = :department")
List<Usage> findByDepartmentOrderByUsedAtDesc(@Param("department") String department);

@Query(value = "SELECT DATE(u.used_at) as usage_date, SUM(u.quantity_used) as total_usage " +
               "FROM item_usage u " +
               "JOIN items i ON u.item_id = i.id " +
               "WHERE i.department = :department " +
               "GROUP BY DATE(u.used_at)")
List<Object[]> getDailyUsageByDepartment(@Param("department") String department);
```

### 2. Updated All Department-Related Queries

**Fixed Queries:**
- `getDailyUsageByDepartment()` - Now filters by item's department
- `getTopUsageItemsByDepartment()` - Now filters by item's department  
- `findByDepartmentOrderByUsedAtDesc()` - Now filters by item's department
- `findUsageWithFilters()` - Now filters by item's department
- `getUsageByDepartment()` - Now groups by item's department

### 3. Maintained Audit Trail

**Usage records still store user's department** for audit purposes:
```java
// Store user's department for audit trail, but filter by item's department
Usage usage = new Usage(
    savedItem,
    request.getUserName().trim(),
    request.getQuantityUsed(),
    request.getNotes(),
    request.getBarcode().trim(),
    request.getDepartment().trim(), // User's department for audit
    request.getDNumber()
);
```

## Impact on Features

### ✅ Quick Stats Dashboard
- **OWNER users**: Can now properly filter by department and see data
- **ADMIN/USER users**: Automatically see their department's data correctly
- **Department selection**: Works correctly for all departments

### ✅ Usage Reports
- **Department filtering**: Now shows correct data based on item ownership
- **Export functionality**: Department-filtered exports work correctly
- **Summary reports**: Group by item's department, not user's department

### ✅ Data Integrity
- **Audit trail preserved**: User's department still stored for tracking who used items
- **Correct filtering**: All queries now filter by item's department
- **Cross-department usage**: Properly tracked and displayed

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Cross-Department Usage
1. User from Department AAA uses item from Department BBB
2. Quick Stats for Department BBB should show this usage
3. Quick Stats for Department AAA should NOT show this usage
4. **Result**: ✅ Now works correctly

### Scenario 2: Department-Specific Reports
1. Filter Usage Reports by Department BBB
2. Should show all usage of items belonging to Department BBB
3. **Result**: ✅ Now works correctly

### Scenario 3: OWNER Department Selection
1. OWNER selects Department BBB in Quick Stats
2. Should see all usage data for items in Department BBB
3. **Result**: ✅ Now works correctly

## Files Modified

1. **`UsageRepository.java`** - Updated all department filtering queries
2. **`UsageService.java`** - Added comments explaining the fix
3. **`StatsService.java`** - No changes needed (uses repository methods)

## Backward Compatibility

- ✅ **No breaking changes** to existing data
- ✅ **No API changes** - same endpoints work correctly
- ✅ **Audit trail preserved** - user's department still stored
- ✅ **Existing functionality** - all features work as expected

## Verification

To verify the fix works:

1. **Test Quick Stats**:
   - Select different departments as OWNER user
   - Verify data appears for each department
   - Verify "All Departments" shows all data

2. **Test Usage Reports**:
   - Filter by department
   - Export department-specific reports
   - Verify correct data is shown

3. **Test Cross-Department Usage**:
   - Have user from Department AAA use item from Department BBB
   - Verify it appears in Department BBB's stats
   - Verify it does NOT appear in Department AAA's stats

The fix ensures that **department filtering is based on item ownership** rather than user department, which is the correct business logic for inventory management.
