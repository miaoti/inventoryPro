# Role-Based Access Control Confirmation

## âœ… **OWNER Users - Department Selection Capability**

### **Quick Stats Dashboard**
**OWNER users can:**
- âœ… **Select any department** from a dropdown list
- âœ… **View "All Departments"** to see system-wide data
- âœ… **Switch between departments** in real-time
- âœ… **See department indicators** in the UI (chips showing current department)
- âœ… **Access department list** via `/stats/departments` endpoint

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Frontend: Quick Stats
if (user?.role === 'OWNER') {
  // OWNER can select any department or view all
  targetDepartment = department || selectedDepartment || undefined;
} else {
  // ADMIN/USER automatically use their own department
  targetDepartment = user?.department;
}
```

```java
// Backend: StatsController
if (user.getRole() == User.UserRole.OWNER) {
  // OWNER can optionally filter by department or see all
  filterDepartment = department;
} else {
  // ADMIN/USER can only see their own department
  filterDepartment = user.getDepartment();
}
```

### **Usage Reports**
**OWNER users can:**
- âœ… **Select any department** from a dropdown list
- âœ… **View "All Departments"** to see system-wide usage
- âœ… **Filter usage records** by any department
- âœ… **Export department-specific** reports
- âœ… **Access department list** via `/stats/departments` endpoint

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Frontend: Usage Reports
{user?.role === 'OWNER' ? (
  <FormControl fullWidth size="small">
    <Select value={selectedDepartment} onChange={handleDepartmentChange}>
      <MenuItem value="">All Departments</MenuItem>
      {availableDepartments.map((dep) => (
        <MenuItem key={dep} value={dep}>{dep}</MenuItem>
      ))}
    </Select>
  </FormControl>
) : (
  <TextField value={user?.department} disabled />
)}
```

## âœ… **ADMIN Users - Department Restriction**

### **Quick Stats Dashboard**
**ADMIN users:**
- âœ… **Automatically see only their department's data**
- âœ… **Cannot switch to other departments**
- âœ… **See department indicator** showing their department
- âœ… **No department selection dropdown**

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Frontend: Quick Stats
if (user?.role === 'OWNER') {
  // OWNER can select any department
  targetDepartment = department || selectedDepartment || undefined;
} else {
  // ADMIN/USER automatically use their own department
  targetDepartment = user?.department;
}
```

### **Usage Reports**
**ADMIN users:**
- âœ… **Automatically filtered to their department**
- âœ… **Cannot select other departments**
- âœ… **See department information** display
- âœ… **Disabled department field** showing their department

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Frontend: Usage Reports
{user?.role === 'OWNER' ? (
  // OWNER gets dropdown selection
  <Select>...</Select>
) : (
  // ADMIN gets disabled field showing their department
  <TextField value={user?.department} disabled />
)}
```

## ðŸ”’ **Security Implementation**

### **Backend Security**
- âœ… **JWT Authentication** required for all endpoints
- âœ… **Role-based filtering** in controllers
- âœ… **Method-level security** with `@PreAuthorize` annotations
- âœ… **Department isolation** enforced at service layer

### **Frontend Security**
- âœ… **Role-based UI rendering** (different components for different roles)
- âœ… **Automatic department assignment** for non-OWNER users
- âœ… **Disabled controls** for restricted users
- âœ… **Visual indicators** showing current department scope

## ðŸ“Š **Data Flow**

### **OWNER User Flow:**
1. **Login** â†’ JWT token with OWNER role
2. **Load departments** â†’ Fetch available departments from `/stats/departments`
3. **Select department** â†’ Choose from dropdown or "All Departments"
4. **View data** â†’ See filtered data for selected department
5. **Switch departments** â†’ Real-time data updates

### **ADMIN User Flow:**
1. **Login** â†’ JWT token with ADMIN role + department
2. **Automatic filtering** â†’ System automatically uses user's department
3. **View data** â†’ See only their department's data
4. **No switching** â†’ Cannot access other departments

## ðŸ§ª **Testing Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: OWNER Department Selection**
- âœ… OWNER selects Department AAA â†’ See AAA's data
- âœ… OWNER selects Department BBB â†’ See BBB's data  
- âœ… OWNER selects "All Departments" â†’ See all data
- âœ… Real-time switching works correctly

### **Scenario 2: ADMIN Department Restriction**
- âœ… ADMIN user from Department AAA â†’ Only see AAA's data
- âœ… Cannot select other departments
- âœ… Department field shows "AAA" and is disabled
- âœ… No access to Department BBB's data

### **Scenario 3: Cross-Department Usage**
- âœ… User from AAA uses item from BBB
- âœ… Quick Stats for BBB shows this usage
- âœ… Quick Stats for AAA does NOT show this usage
- âœ… Usage Reports filter correctly by item ownership

## ðŸ“‹ **API Endpoints**

### **OWNER-Only Endpoints:**
- `GET /stats/departments` - Get available departments for filtering

### **Role-Aware Endpoints:**
- `GET /stats/quick-stats?department=XXX` - Department-aware Quick Stats
- `GET /usage/filtered?department=XXX` - Department-aware Usage Reports

## âœ… **Confirmation**

**Yes, the implementation correctly provides:**

1. **OWNER users** can select any department to view data
2. **ADMIN users** are automatically restricted to their own department
3. **Proper security** is enforced at both frontend and backend
4. **Department filtering** works correctly based on item ownership
5. **UI clearly indicates** current department scope for all users

The system provides the exact functionality you requested with proper role-based access control and department filtering capabilities.
