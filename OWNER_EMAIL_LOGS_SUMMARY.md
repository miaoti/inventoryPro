# OWNER Email Notifications & System Logs Implementation

## Summary of Changes

### ✅ OWNER Email Notifications

#### 1. Database Changes
- **`mysql/init/01-create-owner.sql`**: Updated OWNER user creation to include email alert settings
  - Added `enable_email_alerts = TRUE`
  - Added `enable_daily_digest = TRUE` 
  - Set `alert_email = 'zhongqi0728@gmail.com'`

- **`V19__enable_owner_email_alerts.sql`**: New migration to ensure existing OWNER users have email alerts enabled
  - Updates all OWNER users to have email alerts enabled
  - Sets alert email fallback to main email if not set

#### 2. Email System Verification
- OWNER users are now included in email notifications through:
  - Database-level email alert flags enabled
  - `AlertService.sendNotificationToUsers()` method includes all users with `enable_email_alerts = TRUE`
  - Email credentials validated via GitHub secrets (MAIL_USERNAME, MAIL_PASSWORD)

### ✅ OWNER-Only System Logs Feature

#### 1. Backend Implementation
- **`OwnerLogsController.java`**: New REST controller exclusively for OWNER users
  - `@PreAuthorize("hasRole('OWNER')")` security annotation
  - **Endpoints**:
    - `GET /api/owner/logs/recent` - Get recent system logs with filtering
    - `GET /api/owner/logs/search` - Search logs by query
    - `GET /api/owner/logs/email-logs` - Get email-specific logs
    - `GET /api/owner/logs/system-status` - Get system status and metrics
  - **Security Features**:
    - Sensitive information masking (passwords, secrets, tokens)
    - Line count limits to prevent memory issues
    - Role-based access control

#### 2. Frontend Implementation
- **`/owner-logs/page.tsx`**: New page exclusively for OWNER users
  - **4 Tabs**: Recent Logs, Email Logs, Search Logs, System Status
  - **Features**:
    - Log level filtering (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, ALL)
    - Real-time search functionality
    - Email-specific log filtering
    - System status monitoring (memory, CPU, error counts)
    - Beautiful log formatting with color-coded levels
    - Responsive design for mobile/desktop
  - **Security**: Access denied message for non-OWNER users

#### 3. Navigation Integration
- **`Layout.tsx`**: Added "System Logs" navigation item
  - Only visible to OWNER users (`user?.role === 'OWNER'`)
  - Styled with distinctive red icon
  - Grouped with other OWNER-only features

#### 4. API Integration
- **`api.ts`**: Added `ownerLogsAPI` with authentication guards
  - All endpoints require authentication
  - Clean API interface for frontend consumption

### ✅ Enhanced Debugging System

#### 1. Backend Debugging
- **`MailConfig.java`**: New mail configuration with comprehensive logging
  - Startup validation of email credentials
  - Debug logging for SMTP configuration
  - Clear error messages for configuration issues

- **`EmailServiceImpl.java`**: Enhanced email debugging
  - Detailed logging for each email sending attempt
  - Configuration validation logs
  - Success/failure tracking

- **`AlertService.java`**: Enhanced alert debugging
  - User lookup logging
  - Email sending attempt tracking
  - Detailed error reporting

#### 2. Frontend Debugging
- **Scanner page**: Added email configuration debugging
  - Automatic email config check on page load
  - Console logs for troubleshooting
  - Pre/post usage inventory tracking

- **Debug API**: Email configuration validation endpoints
  - Check mail credentials
  - Test email sending
  - User alert settings verification

### ✅ Code Quality & Security

#### 1. Security Measures
- **Role-based access control**: `@PreAuthorize` annotations
- **Sensitive data protection**: Automatic masking of secrets in logs
- **Input validation**: Line count limits, query sanitization
- **Authentication guards**: All APIs require valid authentication

#### 2. No Breaking Changes
- ✅ Existing functionality preserved
- ✅ Profile page cleaned up (removed duplicate email settings)
- ✅ Settings page remains the single source for email configuration
- ✅ All existing APIs and pages continue to work
- ✅ No modifications to core business logic

### ✅ User Experience

#### 1. OWNER Benefits
- **Email Notifications**: Automatic alerts when inventory is low
- **System Monitoring**: Real-time access to backend logs
- **Troubleshooting**: Built-in debugging tools
- **System Health**: Memory, CPU, and error monitoring

#### 2. Professional Design
- **Clean Interface**: Material-UI components with consistent styling
- **Responsive**: Works on desktop and mobile
- **Color-coded Logs**: Easy identification of log levels
- **Real-time Updates**: Live system status monitoring

## Testing & Validation

### Email Notifications
1. OWNER user has `enable_email_alerts = TRUE` in database
2. Email credentials configured via GitHub secrets
3. Alert triggering tested via inventory usage below safety threshold
4. Debug endpoints available for troubleshooting

### System Logs
1. OWNER-only access enforced by Spring Security
2. Log file access with proper error handling
3. Sensitive information automatically masked
4. Performance optimized with line limits

### Security
1. Non-OWNER users cannot access logs endpoints
2. Authentication required for all operations
3. No exposure of sensitive system information
4. Proper input validation and sanitization
