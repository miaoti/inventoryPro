# Backend and Deployment Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Backend Health Check Issues
**Problem**: Backend health check failing causing containers to be marked as unhealthy
**Solution**:
- Added Spring Boot Actuator dependency to `inventory/build.gradle`
- Created simple `HealthController` with `/health` and `/api/health` endpoints
- Updated Security Config to allow public access to health endpoints
- Changed docker-compose health check from `/api/actuator/health` to `/health`

### 2. Frontend Health Check Issues  
**Problem**: Frontend health check failing
**Solution**:
- Created Next.js API route at `inventory_frontend/app/health/route.ts`
- Updated docker-compose health check to use `/health` endpoint

### 3. Scanner Page Authentication Issues
**Problem**: Scanner page redirecting when it should be public
**Solution**:
- Modified search functionality to only work for authenticated users
- Added authentication check in `performSearch` function
- Updated UI to show login prompt for search when not authenticated
- Removed authenticated-only API calls from useEffect (email debug)
- Core barcode scanning functionality remains public via `barcodeAPI`

### 4. 502 Bad Gateway Issues
**Problem**: Nginx receiving 502 errors when trying to reach backend
**Root Cause**: Backend not starting properly due to missing dependencies and health check failures
**Solution**: Fixed health endpoints so backend starts properly and responds to nginx

## Files Modified

### Backend:
- `inventory/build.gradle` - Added Spring Boot Actuator dependency
- `inventory/src/main/java/com/inventory/controller/HealthController.java` - New health endpoints
- `inventory/src/main/java/com/inventory/config/SecurityConfig.java` - Allow health endpoints

### Frontend:
- `inventory_frontend/app/health/route.ts` - New health API route
- `inventory_frontend/app/scanner/page.tsx` - Fixed authentication for search, kept core scanning public
- `inventory_frontend/app/services/api.ts` - Fixed TypeScript return types for logAPI

### Infrastructure:
- `docker-compose.prod.yml` - Updated health check endpoints

## Testing
After deployment, verify:

1. **Backend Health**: `curl http://129.146.49.129/api/health`
2. **Frontend Health**: `curl http://129.146.49.129/health`
3. **Scanner Public Access**: Visit `https://129.146.49.129/scanner` without login
4. **Core Scanning**: Should work without authentication
5. **Search Feature**: Should prompt for login when not authenticated
6. **Login**: Should work and return to authenticated functionality

## Expected Behavior
- ✅ Backend should start with healthy status
- ✅ Frontend should start with healthy status  
- ✅ Nginx should receive successful responses from both services
- ✅ Scanner page should load without authentication
- ✅ Barcode scanning should work for public users
- ✅ Search and admin features require authentication
- ✅ No more 502 Bad Gateway errors
